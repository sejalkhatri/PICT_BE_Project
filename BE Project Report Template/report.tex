Abstract:
A vending machine is a machine that dispenses items such  as snacks, beverages to customers automatically, after the customer inserts currency or credit into the machine. We are proposing a Platform for vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.But nowadays paying in cash has become a difficulty and cannot be fulfilled every time.Therefore we suggest a platform for the vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.With this approach Online payment for vending machines can be made possible and the stock record is maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor. In addition to which the users are notified about the presence of the vending machine using Web Bluetooth API.

Introduction:

 The Physical Web is a generic term which describes interconnection of physical objects and web. The Physical Web lets to present physical objects in a web. There are different ways to do that.Usually, the web presentation for a physical object could implement with the help
of mobile devices. The basic idea behind the Physical Web is to navigate and control physical objects in the world surrounding
mobile devices with the help of web technologies. Of course, there are different ways to identify and enumerate physical objects.
Nowadays operating the vending machines has been difficult due to cash payments and location issues.

How to overcome this issue?
 We hereby suggest such types of vending machines which offer Online (cashless) payments for the users for easy purchase of items and the Vendors are well informed about the stock management of the machine and they are also aware of the customers past transactions.To begin with we will have a Wi-Fi enabled board on the vending machines which will send beacons to the mobile phones having Bluetooth in their vicinity.
Nowadays bluetooth is an open specification for short-range wireless communication and networking, mainly intended to be a cable replacement between portable and/or fixed electronic devices. The specification also defines techniques for interconnecting large number of nodes in scatternets,thus enabling the establishment of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET).
The user will receive a notification which will contain a URL flashed by the beacon on his cellphone along with suggestions for other products.
and will hence find and approach the vending machine and click on the desired product on his cellphone.The transaction is carried out using the online payment gateways or mobile wallet and is recorded and stored in the cloud which is used for future transactions.
In this project we are using Cloud computing in the functioning of the data,cloud computing has recently emerged as a new
paradigm for hosting and delivering services over the Internet. It is attractive to business owners as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for provisioning, and allows enterprises to start from the small and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand.
Many different algorithms are going to be used in this project namely - The travelling salesperson algorithm,Depth first search.Using such algorithms we will provide a platform which will help the vendors manage the functioning of the vending machines in near future.


\chapter{Problem Definition and scope}
\section{Problem Statement}
 To Automate vending machine functionalities for vendors and enabling easy accessibility for users through online payment and establishing a physical interface with the help of beacons. 


\subsection{Goals and objectives}  
Project Goal :Presently operating the vending machines is not user-friendly and it is observed to be time consuming as well.Our project goal is to increase the scope and quality of the vending machine services provided to the people. 

Project Objective 1:
People use coins or paper money while operating the vending machines due to which there arises a problem when the user does not seem to have exact change with him.
Performance Measure :
Online (cashless) payments are made available for the users for easy purchase of items.

Project Objective 2:
The vendors are not aware about the stock required in the vending machines when excess usage of the products occur.
Performance Measure :
Vendors are well informed about the stock management of the machine and are also aware of the customers past transactions.

Project Objective 3 :
Finding a vending machine in new locations everytime becomes difficult for people.
Performance Measure :
The users are notified about the presence of the vending machine available in their current location using the Web Bluetooth API.
	
 \subsection{Statement of scope} 
This project will consist of creating a platform for vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.Online payment for vending machines made possible and stock record maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor. Modules of the platform will include a firmware where hardware is used,cloud communication and a frontend available for users as well as for vendors respectively.

Limit of the project will be internet dependency ,so better connection is required otherwise the entire system flops .


Functionality mechanism is concentrated on removing the cash payment barrier on the vending machine .

Final product will be used at public places like railway stations,airports,bus stands and can be used by private vendors.
\section{Software context} 
Online payment for vending machines made possible and stock record maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor. Modules of the platform will include a firmware where hardware is used,cloud communication and a frontend available for users as well as for vendors respectively.
The software entities used are Web Bluetooth API,Linux,Eclipse(mars).
Web bluetooth is the technology in which a bluetooth enabled device is used to flash url which can notify people about a thing in the area ,This is a way towards making things speak .
This device is placed at the vending machine and configured to flash a particular url using Seripheral Interface from the controller .
The controller is wifi enabled ,so cloud communication is done using awsiot js sdk on the device .
The cloud communication also happens at the user side for  payment and then the cloud notifies the vending machine that payment is done and vending machine disposes the product.
\section{Major Constraints}
Need of google chrome browser
The user should have google chrome browser to take advantage of this service as currently the web bluetooth technology is supported by only google chrome.

Availability of Wi-Fi connections.
The vending machine should be placed in the place where wifi availability is there ,for smoother connection and faster product delivery.If the internet fluctuates then user will have to wait for product and this in turn lead to decrease in product sale.
 
Location of the vending machines.
Vending machine should be placed where it can be accesible to the people i.e the bluetooth range .


\section{Methodologies of Problem solving and efficiency issues}
The single problem can be solved by different solutions.  This considers the performance parameters for each approach. Thus considers the efficiency issues.

\section{Scenario in which multi-core, Embedded and Distributed Computing used}

 We will have a Wi-Fi enabled board on the vending machines which will send beacons to the mobile phones having Bluetooth in their vicinity.
 
 The user will receive a notification which will contain a URL flashed by the beacon on his cellphone along with suggestions for other products.

The user will hence find and approach the vending machine and click on the desired product on his cellphone.

 The transaction is carried out using the online payment gateways or mobile wallet and is recorded and stored in the cloud which is used for future transactions.

 The vending machine then dispenses the product ordered by the user.

The vendor will have an updated list of the stock remaining in the cloud.

\section{Outcome}

 Online (cashless) payments are available for the users for easy purchase of items.
Vendors are well informed about the stock management of the machine and they are also aware of the customers past transactions.

\chapter{Software requirement specification  (SRS is to be prepared using relevant mathematics derived and software engg. Indicators in Annex A and B)}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose and Scope of Document}
Purpose:\\
An SRS is written in precise, clear and plain language so that it can be reviewed by a business
analyst or customer representative with minimal technical expertise. However it also contains
analytical models (use case diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, data dictionary etc.) which
can be used for the detailed design and the development of the software system. SRS is one of
the most critical pieces of software development since it acts as the bridge betweens the
software developers and business analysts. An incomplete or incorrect SRS can have
disastrous effects on a software project.\\
Scope:\\
Primarily, the scope pertains to the Vending machine providing services to the user and the
vendor. It focuses on the vendor, which allows for the sales, distribution and marketing of the
products through the vending machine.
This SRS is also aimed at specifying requirements of product to be developed but it can also be
applied to assist in the selection of in-house and commercial software products. The standard can
be used to create software requirements specifications directly or can be used as a model for
defining a organization or project specific stan\\
\subsection{Overview of responsibilities of Developer}
The developer will carry out the following activities:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Requirement gathering
\item Planning of the project
\item Designing various modules
\item Implementation of the project
\item Testing of the modules (white box and black box)
\item Deployment of the product (real life usage)

\end{enumerate}
\section{Usage Scenario}
Scenario1: User doesn't get notified :\\
This happens if users bluetooth is not activated ,than he doesn't get the notification .\\
Scenario2:If the wifi connection breaks while the delivery process\\
The details are saved at the cloud side and if the vending machine  is reconnected then it makes the delivery as the payment status is updated .\\\

 \subsection{User profiles}  
There are two actors involved in the use case diagram.\\
1. User\\
2. Vendor\\
The user is the person who approaches the vending machine to buy a product and the vendor is
the person who sells various products by regularly stocking them up in the vending machine. The
relationship between them is similar to a buyer and seller.\\

\section{Functional Model and Description}  
Our project consists of these software functions--\\
Interfacing knit board with the vending machine.
In this function we are writing codes and storing them on the stlink programmer.
The stlink works with both its end, one end is connected to the vending machine's motors and the other end is connected to the knit board.
Using the flash process we will store and use the code dynamically.\\

Knit board to AWS (Amazon Web Services)--\\
In this function we will connect the knit board functionalities to the cloud server.
This will be done via the REST(Representational state transfer) protocol.\\

REST : They are one way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the internet. REST-compliant web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.  \\
There are six guiding constraints that define a RESTful system.These constraints restrict the ways that the server may process and respond to client requests so that, by operating within these constraints, the service gains desirable non-functional properties, such as performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.If a service violates any of the required constraints, it cannot be considered RESTful.\\

Cloud to Device(vendor's side)--\\
In this function we will connect the cloud to the Vendor's device through a mqtt protocol.
Mqtt(MQ Telemetry Transport ) Protocol :\\
It is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922)publish-subscribe-based "lightweight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited.
Further the vendor will have his own database server where all the data collected will be stored and saved.Here various algorithms will be applied to find the location of the vending machine which needs the reloading of products.
We are providing a platform to the vendors such that they will be able to store the user's past transaction history as well.\\

\subsection{Non Functional Requirements:}
Interface Requirements:\\
SPI -Serial Peripheral Interface used to connect Stepper motor driver  to Knit board.\\
Requirement : The driver must support SPI interface and also the board used should support SPI interface .\\
Performance Requirements:\\
Proper Functioning Wifi module to make most of the internet connectivity.\\
Faster AWS responce for quick disposal of products as user would most likely be in hurry in most of the cases\\
Software quality attributes :\\
 Reliability : Complete Reliability on the internet access in the area \\
 Modifiability :Modifiability is supported as the Beacon url is modifiable according to the vendor. \\
 Performance : Performace is measured by day to day testing and respective changes are made to enhance the performance \\

 \subsection{Software Interface Description}	 
Software interfacing is done between knit board (wifi enabled board) and Amazon web services  using aws iot js sdk .So the data is updated in time intervals to the cloud .Concept called thing shadows is used at the cloud side to dynamically update data .\\
Interfacing is also done between cloud and vendor device for dynamically publishing the updated data at the AWS .


\chapter{Detailed Design Document using Appendix A and B}
 \section{Introduction}  
 We will have a Wi-Fi enabled board on the vending machines which will send beacons to the mobile phones having Bluetooth in their vicinity.
 
 The user will receive a notification which will contain a URL flashed by the beacon on his cellphone along with suggestions for other products.

The user will hence find and approach the vending machine and click on the desired product on his cellphone.

 The transaction is carried out using the online payment gateways or mobile wallet and is recorded and stored in the cloud which is used for future transactions.

 The vending machine then dispenses the product ordered by the user.

The vendor will have an updated list of the stock remaining in the cloud.

\section{Compoent Design} 
Algorithm used is Dijkatra's algorithm .Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.[3]:196–206 It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. As a result, the shortest path algorithm is widely used in network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). It is also employed as a subroutine in other algorithms such as Johnson's.\\
Explanation: \\
The cost which we will be using will not just be the cost of the path but the added priority of the product\\
The cost = distance + PriorityMappedValue(depending on product) \\
So the product with highest priority that is which is higher demand  will be given lower value which will reduce the cost and that path will be preferred\\
Accordingly we can calculate and let the vendor know which machine he should approach first\\
